### Docker Installation

Yes, installing Docker on Debian 12 is very similar to installing it on Kali Linux since both are Debian-based distributions. The steps are essentially the same, but let's go through the installation process for Docker on Debian 12.

Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Update the system
Before installing Docker, ensure your system is updated:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

### Step 2: Install required packages
You’ll need a few packages for Docker installation:
```bash
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
```

### Step 3: Add Docker’s official GPG key
Add the Docker GPG key to verify package integrity:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```

### Step 4: Add Docker’s APT repository
Set up the stable repository for Docker:
```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

### Step 5: Update the package index
After adding the Docker repository, update the package list:
```bash
sudo apt update
```

### Step 6: Install Docker
Now install Docker Engine:
```bash
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

### Step 7: Start and enable Docker
Start the Docker service and enable it to start at boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

### Step 8: Verify Docker installation
Check if Docker is installed and running:
```bash
sudo docker --version
sudo docker run hello-world
```

This should install Docker on your Debian 12 system, just like on Kali Linux.
