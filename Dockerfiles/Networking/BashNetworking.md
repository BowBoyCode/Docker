To create a Docker container with a Bash terminal that supports networking, you can use the same basic Dockerfile but ensure that your container is run with appropriate network settings. Docker containers have networking enabled by default, so the primary addition would be in how you run the container.

Here’s the Dockerfile again for reference:

```dockerfile
# Use the official Ubuntu image as a base
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Update the package list and install Bash
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y bash

# Set Bash as the default shell
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

### Building the Docker Image

1. Save the Dockerfile in a directory.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile.
3. Build the Docker image using the following command:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-bash-terminal .
   ```

### Running the Docker Container with Networking

To run the container with networking enabled, you simply need to run the container with the default network settings. Here’s how to do it:

```bash
docker run -it --network bridge my-bash-terminal
```

By default, Docker uses the `bridge` network driver for containers. This means the container will be connected to the default bridge network and will have networking capabilities such as DNS resolution, internet access, and the ability to communicate with other containers on the same network.

### Verifying Network Connectivity

To verify that networking is working inside your container, you can run some network commands inside the container:

1. Start the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --network bridge my-bash-terminal
   ```

2. Once inside the Bash terminal of the container, you can use commands like `ping`, `curl`, or `apt-get` to test network connectivity:

   ```bash
   # Ping a website to test connectivity
   ping google.com

   # Fetch a web page to test internet access
   curl http://example.com

   # Install a package to ensure apt-get can reach the repositories
   apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget
   ```

These steps will ensure that your container has networking enabled and you can interact with external networks and other Docker containers.
